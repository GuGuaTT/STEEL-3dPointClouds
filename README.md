# Steel-3dPointClouds Database: data generation and data usage scripts

This is the repository for the [Steel-3dPointClouds Database](https://github.com/GuGuaTT/STEEL-3dPointClouds), providing scripts for data generation and feature processing. It also offers examples demonstrating the dataset's potential in various applications.

## Usage

This repository includes three main directories: 

- `AutoGen` contains scripts used for generating the Steel-3DPointClouds Database.
- `FeatProc` houses the primary post-processing scripts.
- `Examples` provides three use cases showcasing the potential applications of the database.

Each directory offers detailed instructions and explanations for the respective scripts. Note that all the data is generated via ABAQUS 2019. For other versions, certain changes may be required for the scripts.
